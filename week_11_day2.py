print(" Welcome to the Python Review Activity!")
print("You’ll review variables, strings, numbers, and print formatting.\n")

# Step 1: Create Variables
# TODO: Replace the values below with your own info
first_name = "Osmar"
age = 16
favorite_color = "Blue"
favorite_number = 7

#  Step 2: Practice String Operations
# 1. Print your name in uppercase


# 2. Print how many letters are in your name
print(len(first_name))

# 3. Combine your name and favorite color into one message


#  Step 3: Math Practice
# Use arithmetic operators with your favorite number
print(str(16) + str(7))

#  Step 4: User Input Practice
# Ask the user two questions and combine answers
number = input("Pick a number? ")
print("Your number is: " + number)
number_1 = input("Pick another number")
print()





# ⚙️ Step 5: Final Challenge (combine it all)
